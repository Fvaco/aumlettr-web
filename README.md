# :sparkles: Aumlettr
Aumlettr is a website where you can meet people around the world. 

The farther your pen friend lives, the longer it will take your message to arrive. Make your letter be worth the wait!

Share your passion and way of thinking with everybody out there. Learn new cultures and train your writing in other languages. Possibilities are endless!

This project is strongly inspired by Kevin Wong's Slowly app (https://www.getslowly.com/).
